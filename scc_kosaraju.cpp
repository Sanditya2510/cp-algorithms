// Strongly connected component is subset of vertices C 
// such that any two vertices of this subset are reachable 
// from each other, i.e. for any u,vâˆˆC
// It is obvious, that strongly connected components do not 
// intersect each other, i.e. this is a partition of all graph vertices
// Thus we can give a definition of condensation graph GSCC as a 
// graph containing every strongly connected component as one vertex.
// The most important property of the condensation graph is that it is acyclic.

// When we transpose graph and travel in the same way as our original dfs
// call, then obviously the reverse edges would cause the control to stay inside
// the current component
